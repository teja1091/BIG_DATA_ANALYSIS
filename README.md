## 🧩 Data Processing Workflow

1. **Data Collection**  
   Data was gathered from multiple sources (CSV, APIs, or databases).

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Removed missing or inconsistent values  
   - Standardized column names and formats  
   - Derived new metrics (e.g., averages, totals, ratios)  

3. **Data Modeling in Power BI**  
   - Created relationships between tables  
   - Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX  
   - Optimized data model for better refresh performance  

4. **Dashboard Design**  
   - KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)  
   - Trend analysis visuals  
   - Interactive slicers for region, time, and category filters  
   - Drill-down functionality for deep analysis
